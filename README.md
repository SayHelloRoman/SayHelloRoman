### Hello there!

Hi, my name is Roman and I'm very excited to meet you in my profile.

I live in Ukraine and love to develop all sorts of things: website backends, bots, games, utils and many more!


I am currently working on [AkainuBot](https://akainubot.github.io/AkainuWeb/). The project is over 6 months old.
Today there is already a whole team of developers.


I also have experience with such technologies:

- Python: Backend - 1 years
- PostgreSQL - 1 years
- MongoDB - 1 years

Right now I'm learning JavaScript(Vue.js), html and css.

Here are my contact details for communication:
